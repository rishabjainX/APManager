## AP Physics 1 Course Structure

The app includes a complete AP Physics 1 curriculum structure based on the College Board framework:

### Units Covered:
1. **Kinematics** (10-16%) - Motion in one and two dimensions
2. **Dynamics** (16-20%) - Forces and Newton's laws
3. **Circular Motion & Gravitation** (6-8%) - Uniform circular motion and gravitational forces
4. **Energy** (20-24%) - Work, energy, and conservation
5. **Momentum** (10-16%) - Linear momentum and conservation
6. **Simple Harmonic Motion** (4-6%) - Oscillatory motion
7. **Torque & Rotational Motion** (10-16%) - Rotational dynamics
8. **Fluids** (4-6%) - Fluid statics and dynamics

Each unit contains detailed topics with learning objectives and status tracking.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Development Server**:
   ```bash

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Routing**: React Router
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Icons**: Lucide React

## Data Structure

The app uses a hierarchical structure:
- **Courses** ‚Üí **Units** ‚Üí **Topics** ‚Üí **Notes**
- Each level can have associated metadata and progress tracking
- Notes are linked to specific topics for organization
- Status tracking provides progress visibility

## Contributing

This is a personal project for AP course management. The structure is designed to be easily extensible for additional AP courses beyond Physics 1.
